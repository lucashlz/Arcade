---HOW ARCADE WORKS:

    ARCADE HAS 3 DIFFERENT PARTS: CORE, GAMES, AND GRAPHICS.

    THE CORE MANAGES ALL THE PROCESSES!

    GRAPHICS AND GAMES ARE CALLED BY THE CORE WITH THE HELP OF A DYNAMIC LOADER.

    THE CHOSEN GAME/GRAPHIC IS LOADED IN THE CORE AND CAN BE STARTED.

    OUR ARCADE HAS 3 GRAPHICS LIBRARIES: NCURSES, SDL2, AND SFML.

    AND 2 GAMES: NIBBLE AND SNAKE.


---THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE!

    YOU CAN CHANGE THE CORE BY USING YOUR OWN IF YOUR CORE USES A DYNAMIC LOADER TO LOAD THE SELECTED LIBRARY.

    YOU CAN ADD A GAME BY ADDING IT TO THE "games" DIRECTORY AND MAKING SURE TO CHECK IF THE GAME IS AVAILABLE BY CHECKING THE LIBRARIES DIRECTORY AND THE AVAILABLE LIST OF GAMES IN "games.txt".

    YOU CAN ADD A GRAPHIC BY ADDING IT TO THE "graphics" DIRECTORY AND MAKING SURE TO CHECK IF THE GRAPHIC IS AVAILABLE BY CHECKING THE LIBRARIES DIRECTORY AND THE AVAILABLE LIST OF GRAPHICS IN "graphics.txt".


---SCORES

    IF THE GAME AND GRAPHIC ARE AVAILABLE, YOUR SCORE ON THE GAME IS AUTOMATICALLY REDIRECTED TO THE "Scores.txt" FILE IN THE "Scores" DIRECTORY AND WRITTEN LIKE THIS: "USER_NAME/GAME/SCORE".

    IF YOU WANT TO ADD A GAME OR GRAPHIC, CHECK THE IGRAPHIC AND IGAME INTERFACES.
